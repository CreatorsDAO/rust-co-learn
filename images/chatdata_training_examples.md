```
When answering questions, 
you need to follow the data types defined in the schema and ensure that the fields used in your query statement exist in the types defined in the schema. 
For example, if there is a type called Wallet that has only one field named tokenBalance and no field named balance, 
you cannot define a field named balance when answering questions. 
You need to follow the types defined in the schema layer by layer and only use the fields defined in the schema to answer questions.
If the question does not explicitly specify a field, you need to summarize the closest field based on the question, and then provide an answer.


example 1: 

questions:

You are currently reading a GraphQL schema, which allows users to easily query on-chain data through these schemas. Assuming you are a GraphQL expert, you now need to understand various forms of questions raised by users and provide appropriate answers. The answer consists of two parts: one is a valid GraphQL query statement, and the other is the query statement's parameters. Some examples are provided below for your reference. Additionally, please note that your GraphQL query statements should strictly follow the types defined in the schema and cannot be customized. If the user's question does not correspond to any schema fields, you need to understand the user's intent and select the closest field to construct the GraphQL query statement.

example 1: 

possible questions: 
1. Query the contract with the address 0xf2A22B900dde3ba18Ec2AeF67D4c8C1a0DAB6aAC.
2. Please check the contract at 0xf2A22B900dde3ba18Ec2AeF67D4c8C1a0DAB6aAC.
3. Can you look up the contract located at 0xf2A22B900dde3ba18Ec2AeF67D4c8C1a0DAB6aAC?
4. Investigate the contract identified by 0xf2A22B900dde3ba18Ec2AeF67D4c8C1a0DAB6aAC.
5. Examine the contract associated with the address 0xf2A22B900dde3ba18Ec2AeF67D4c8C1a0DAB6aAC.

your answer(Although the above questions are in different forms, they express the same meaning, so the answer to these questions is the same, therefore you need to fully understand the user's question): 

query Query($contractAddress: String!) {
     ethereum {
          contract(contractAddress: $contractAddress) {
               address
               name
               symbol
               supportedErcInterfaces
               isVerified

your answer(Please note that this request corresponds to a deep query hierarchy with multiple levels of nesting. When constructing GraphQL query statements, you also need to first understand the user's request purpose, then read the schema content layer by layer, and decide what information to provide to the user. In general, user requests may be vague, so you only need to provide important field information and not all field information): 

query Query($address: String!) {
          ethereum {
               walletByAddress(address: $address) {
                    walletNFTs {
                         totalCount
                         edges {
                              node {
                                   nftsCount
                                   nft {
                                        name

                                             address
                                             name
                                             symbol
                                        }
                                   }

example 4: a wrong example: please try to understand this point

question: 
Please check the balance of this account address: 0x668e8A0DB87FA6ce64B2e13eD12a3981f59ef418

wrong answer:

query Query($address: String!) {
     ethereum {
          walletByAddress(address: $address) {
               balance
          }
     }
}


variables = {
    "address": "0x668e8A0DB87FA6ce64B2e13eD12a3981f59ef418"
}

Why is the example above incorrect? Because the 'balance' field is not defined in the schema provided to you, using this field would result in an invalid GraphQL query statement. Here is the correct answer: Note that the user wants to query the 'balance' field, but it is not defined in the schema, so we chose the closest meaning field 'tokenBalances'. Since 'tokenBalances' has several subfields, we continue to query layer by layer and return some important field information to the user.

right answer:

query Query($address: String!) {
          ethereum {
               walletByAddress(address: $address) {
                    address
                    tokenBalances {
                         totalCount
                         edges {
                              node {
                                   totalBalance
                                   contractAddress
                                   contract {
                                        name
                                        symbol
                                        decimals
                                   }
                              }
                         }
                    }

possible questions:
Please look up the transaction history for this account: 0x8d296ecc0bfed0a0d22a01fa0b23c459bce42e83

your answer(The following answer is a possible result, as the user has only informed you that they need to query the account's transactions without providing further specifications. Therefore, you need to use your own judgment to provide relevant information):

query Query($address: String!) {
               ethereum {
                    walletByAddress(address: $address) {
                         transactions {
                              totalCount
                              edges {
                                   node {
                                        fromAddress

                                   }
                              }
                         }
                    }
               }
          }
          
variables = {
    "address": "0x8d296ecc0bfed0a0d22a01fa0b23c459bce42e83"
}  

An example of how to understand a schema: for instance, the following schema definition has three fields under Query, and the types of these three fields are all EVMSchemaType. Under the EVMSchemaType type, there are many other fields defined, such as walletByAddress(address: String!): Wallet. This field requires an address parameter when used and returns a Wallet type, and Wallet in turn defines many types, such as tokenBalances, which returns a WalletTokenBalancesConnection type, and so on. When building a valid GraphQL query statement, you need to query each field layer by layer, meaning you can match the user's request with the meaning of the field names and select the field that is most relevant. It is important to reiterate that the GraphQL query statement fields you construct must come from the schema and cannot be customized, or else an invalid query statement will be generated.Also please note: there are too many levels involved here, and not all of them are listed.
